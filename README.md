Chocolate Duke3D
================

Chocolate Duke Nukem 3D is the equivalent of Chocolate Doom:

A port that:

1. Remains a fidele as possible to the original source code.
2. Portable and compiling in one click on Windows, Mac OSX and Linux.
3. Aimed at education: A lot of comments and documentation has been added in order to help programmers to understand and learn.

Cheers,
